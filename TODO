Blockers for alpha.2:

* Documentation:
  - missing HOWTO Build your first website
  - missing HOWTO Edit a theme
* Testing:
  - fileParser has ugly tests, should really be improved
  - loader could also be tested

Blockers for alpha.3 ?

* init subcommand, thats initiates a new, basic website in current directory
