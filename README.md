# Juliet
#### The lightweight static website generator !

*WiP, documentation is coming soon.*

Juliet is a powerful static website generator written in Python. It is designed
to be as lightweight and understandable as possible (less than 500 well
commented LOC !).

Juliet is easily adaptable, forkable, and offers all functionalities you'd
except from a modern static website generator. It uses Jinja2 templates,
supports modular theming, markdown articles and is easily configurable via YAML
configuration files.

### Yet another static website generator ?

Alright, there are already a lot of powerful, well-designed static websites
generators. So, why Juliet over Pelican or Jekyll ?

Is it quite simple: Pelican and Jekyll are great, but Pelican and Jekyll are
*big* !

Juliet is designed to stay small, simple, understandable and forkable. It
provides everything you need, without superfluous features.

### Dependencies

Juliet has been successfully tested on Debian Stretch with following
dependencies (Debian dependencies in brackets):
