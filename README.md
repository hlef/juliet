# Juliet

Juliet is a powerful static websites generator written in Python. It is designed
to be as lightweight and understandable as possible.

Juliet is easily adaptable, forkable, and provides all functionalities one could
except from a modern static websites generator. It uses Jinja2 templates,
supports modular theming, markdown articles with Pygments syntax highlighting
and is easily configurable via YAML configuration files.

## Yet another static website generator ?

Alright, there are already a lot of powerful, well-designed static websites
generators. So, why Juliet over Pelican or Jekyll ?

Is it quite simple: Pelican and Jekyll are great, but Pelican and Jekyll are
*big* !

Juliet is designed to stay small, simple, understandable and forkable. It
provides everything you need, without superfluous features.
