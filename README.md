# Juliet
#### The lightweight static website generator :sunny:

*WiP, documentation is coming soon.*

Juliet is a powerful static website generator, designed to be as lightweight
and understandable as possible (less than 500 well commented LOC !).

Juliet is easily adaptable, forkable, and offers all functionalities you'd
except from a modern static website generator. It uses Jinja2 templates,
supports modular theming and is easily configurable via YAML configuration
files.

#### Why Juliet ? Pelican and Jekyll are already perfect !

Pelican and Jekyll are nice, but Pelican and Jekyll are **big**.

Juliet is designed to stay small, simple and forkable.

#### Dependencies

Juliet has been successfully tested on Debian Stretch with following dependencies (Debian
dependencies in brackets):

 * [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) , version 2.8 (python3-jinja2)
 * [pyyaml](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml), version 3.12 (python3-yaml)
 * [python-slugify](https://github.com/un33k/python-slugify), version 1.2.1 (python3-slugify)
